The link buttons are not currently working. Was included to test for styling. Need more knowledge and skills to make functional  -->

  <!-- This is a navbar that was included so that a user would have something to navigate with even if they scroll. It overlaps on the title when tested on a colleges device, however, so it was commented out.
   Not deleted because I still want to include it in the next revision, but it is hard to diagnose as it works on my main device. If I can't make it work for next revision, it will be deleted out.
